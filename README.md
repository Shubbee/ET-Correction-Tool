# ET-Correction-Tool
A python tool to automate the creation of the MIKE SHE evapotranspiration Dfs2 file from reference ET time-series at stations across the model domain and correct the reference ET data by a solar radiation factors, corresponding to the grid location and month of the year.

Technical approach: 
Step 1: Read all the ET Dfs0s and create an ET time-series data frame. 

Step 2: Read the polygons shape file which define the zones with unique ET time-series. 

Step 3: Identify ET time-series for each polygon in the domain.

Step 4: Identify all the solar radiation grid points inside a polygon.

Step 5: Correct the ET time-series for the zone identified in step 4 for every grid point by the corresponding solar radiation factors for each month of the year and store the data in a NumPy array. Repeat this step for all the polygons. 

Step 6: Create a Dfs2 file based on - the corrected ET dataset (np array) generated in step 5; time span, timestep interval from the input ET Dfs0; grid size and projection system from the solar radiation correction factor input shapefile.
